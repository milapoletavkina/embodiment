        <h2>“Presence and Seeing”</h2>
        <p>Format: audio + text · guided practice for two</p>
        <p>A gentle embodiment-based practice designed for couples who wish to reconnect, soften, and rediscover their natural intimacy.</p>

        <p>This session is for you if you feel that warmth has faded, connection has become less alive, or you long for a deeper presence with one another.</p>
        <p>Instead of analyzing or trying to “fix” anything, you explore your connection through breath, attention, and embodied awareness.</p>

        <p>What this practice helps you experience:</p>
        <p>• A slower, grounded return to the shared sense of “we”</p>
        <p>• Reconnecting through presence rather than words</p>
        <p>• Allowing warmth and openness to naturally reappear</p>

        <p>The practice includes a full guided audio session and a written text version you can return to anytime.</p>
        <p>No prior experience is needed — only willingness to be present together.</p>

        <p>Duration: 20–30 minutes</p>
        <p>Format: downloadable audio + text instructions</p>
