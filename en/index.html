            <h1>Awareness. Choice. Action.</h1>
            <p>Our body creates certain possibilities for us in life — and limits others.
            Embodiment coaching helps you clearly recognize what is truly your limitation, and where new freedom opens up for you.
            <br><br>
            Embodiment is awareness lived through the body.
            It's not theory — it is your personal, lived somatic experience.</p>
            <span class="emphasis">For those who are ready to notice, feel, regulate, choose, and transform — through the body and in the body.
            Embodiment is not theory. It is your personal, lived somatic experience.</span>

                            <span>Embodiment is the union of body and mind, allowing you to experience yourself through your somatic experience, not just through thinking.
                            The body is the closest and most accessible part of us that we can feel and understand.</span>

                            <p>3. Stress and the Body: Why Embodiment Helps</p>
                            <span>Stress manifests primarily in the body - through muscle tension, breathing patterns, posture, and fatigue.</span>

                            <p>Embodiment helps you recognize these signals and work with them directly, rather than just thinking about the problem.</p>
                            <p>Through awareness, attention to the body, and movement, we can:</p>
                            <p>- regulate physical and emotional responses</p>
                            <p>- restore energy and resilience</p>

            <p>Hello, my name is Mila, and I am an Embodiment Coach.</p>
            <h3>My professional strength lies in my ability  to see a person in their full complexity and to select embodiment practices for their goals.</h3> 
            <br>
            <p>In my previous career, I worked for 10 years in Moscow as a structural design engineer, part of a team of professionals developing complex and unique architectural projects. Deadlines, long hours, exhaustion, stress, burnout, and the feeling of having no inner resources for a full, meaningful life were all very familiar to me.<br><br>
I also carry the experience of supporting my mother through cancer treatment — and through her full and successful recovery.<br>
I know firsthand what it means to move to another country, to navigate 10 years of living and integrating into a new culture, and to support my family through the challenges of adaptation.<br><br>
Like many people during the pandemic, I found myself searching for new meaning and new directions. I went through retraining, a divorce with an emphasis on preserving respectful co-parenting, long periods of not being able to see my family in Russia, financial instability, working in a foreign language with only one day off per week, and the loss of important relationships.<br><br>
All of these events were lived through the body.<br>
And my path would not have been so consciously navigated without various studies and trainings — in general psychology, psychosomatics, hypnosis, and multiple embodiment- and body-based practices.<br><br>
I can say with certainty: every state we experience — sorrow or joy — is directly reflected in the body. This is our nature.<br>
But learning how to consciously choose how we want to live through each life experience — this is a skill we can cultivate, and one that deeply matters.<br><br>
An embodiment coach is someone who works through the body's attention.<br>
I invite you into a deeply interesting and meaningful exploration of yourself.</p>
